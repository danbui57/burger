# burger-app
A restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they would like to eat. Whenever a user submits a burger's name, my app will display the burger on the left side of the page.  The name will then wait to be associated with the name of the customer. when both fields have been submitted the burger name and customer will be stored into the database and move to the right side of the page in alphabetical order according to the pizza name.
